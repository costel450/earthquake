# earthquake
 In this project will be determined: <br />
• The analysis of the frequency distribution of earthquakes according to the period of their registration <br />
• It will be determined if there is a correlation between the duration in seconds of an earthquake and magnitude according to the depth of the earthquake<br />
• It will be determined if there is a time of day when the frequency of earthquakes is higher than other hours<br />
• Earthquake frequencies for each continent will be visualized<br />
• The countries where the most earthquakes occurred and the evolution over the years<br />
• frequency according to years and the causes of the frequency will be determined<br />
• The frequency of earthquakes in each country depending on the year and alo will be analyzed the cause of  their production<br />
• The frequency of earthquakes and fluctuations that occurred in the will be visualized in the first 5 countries where the highest frequency was recorded<br />
• A case study will be established to determine if the increased frequency of an earthquake has any impact on the likelihood of a larger earthquake occurring<br />
